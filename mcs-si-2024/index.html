  Symbolic Computation for Differential Equations  <br /> 
 A Special Issue of <a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/11786">Mathematics in Computer Science</a>  <br />

<p>Differential equations play a prominent role in many scientific disciplines including physics, chemistry,  ecology, and biology. They enable predictions 
and deeper understanding of the long-term behavior in modeling scientific real-world phenomena important for science and engineering. 
Over the last three decades, advanced software tools, implemented along with newly developed algebraic methods on modern computers, have become available for 
efficient symbolic computation, helping to make the theory of differential equations essentially more powerful. Nowadays, symbolic computation methods are 
indispensable in the study of ODEs, offering tools to derive exact solutions, deepen theoretical understanding, verify numerical results, develop algorithms, 
extend solutions to broader classes of equations, and analyze mathematical models ultimately advancing our comprehension and application of 
differential equations in diverse scientific fields.</p>

<p>We are delighted to announce a forthcoming special issue of <a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/11786">Mathematics in Computer Science</a> focused on <b>Symbolic Computation for Differential Equations</b> 
and dedicated to exploring the profound interconnection between ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and symbolic computation. This issue aims to shed light 
on the intricate relationship between these two fields, showcasing their collaborative potential and innovative applications. We invite researchers, scholars, 
and experts in the realms of ODEs and symbolic computation to contribute their original works to the issue.</p>
