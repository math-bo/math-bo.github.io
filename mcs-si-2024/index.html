<p>Differential equations appear almost everywhere in science and engineering. 
They have been used broadly to describe scientific phenomena in biology, economics, control theory, and complex networks. 
The methods of symbolic computation have proven to be powerful in dealing with the problem of the qualitative analysis of stability and bifurcations for systems of differential equations. 
It is believed that symbolic and algebraic computation will continue playing an extremely important role in the development of the classical qualitative theory of differential equations. 
With Hilbert’s 16th problem underlined as an open challenge, advanced research supported by powerful methods of symbolic computation will certainly make the qualitative theory one of the most 
useful tools for automated problem-solving in the field of differential equations and beyond.</p>

<p>The journal Mathematics in Computer Science invites researchers and practitioners to contribute to a special issue focused on Symbolic Computation for Differential Equations, encompassing a 
wide range of topics exploring the interplay between symbolic computation and differential equations.</p>
